    <h2> About </h2>
This project was made by me, Benjamin Mørch, and as the capstone of my master in Digital Humanities at The City University of New York. I have a background in teaching, facilitating and media production with a bachelor degree from Copenhagen university. 
<br> <br>
<b> Project </b> <br>
My project is based around the idea of giving teachers inspiration and vocabulary to talk with students about technology's impact on our future society, especially focusing on AI, data and algorithms. In order to create the space for teachers to be inspired and learn themselves I have made a website where they easily can get an overview of the material, explore more and get inspired. The developed project should be looked upon as a pilot as I wish to get more feedback from students and teachers as well as potentially get an organization, company or other interested in hosting the website. The educational material is developed from my own experience of teaching high school students as well as inspired by existing developed assignments and materials, for example from the book Computational Thinking Education in K–12 edited by Siu-Cheung Kong and Harold Abelson and the ADD project; algorithms, data and democracy project.

<b> Acknowledgement </b> <br>
A special thanks to my advisor Maura Smale, Matthew Gold, Krystyna Michael and Luke Waltzer for feedback and inspiration for this project. This capstone would not have been made without support and help from professors and fellow students from the sharing their feedback and reflections.
