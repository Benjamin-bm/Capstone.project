    <h2> How is data used?</h2>
    <em>This debate exercise is for students to reflect on some of their initial thoughts on sharing data online.</em>
 <br>
    <br>
    Make a line in the classroom where one end represents strongly agreeing and the other strongly disagrees. Ask the students the following questions and ask the students to place themselves on the line according to their beliefs. Talk to students during the exercise to explain their standpoint. <br>
    <br>
- Is it okay for Instagram and Tik Tok to know your address, family members and who you are dating? <br> <br>
- Is it okay for Instagram and Tik Tok to know your sexual orientation? <br> <br>
- Is it okay for Instagram and Tik Tok to know what you think about equal pay for men and women? Or the right to change your legal gender as a kid? <br> <br>
- What about the information you share with your doctor is that okay for your school and parents to know this? <br> <br>
- Is it okay for our politicians to know this information? <br> <br>
- Is it okay for Google to know this information? <br>

  <div><h2> What can data say about us?</h2>
    <br>
    <em>This assignment is meant for the students to explore their own social media accounts like Instagram or TikTok to find out what ideas the apps have about them.
    </em><br>
    <br>
    Data is according to Cambridge University Press: 
    <br>
“Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making, or information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer.” (Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2023).
But what data does social media have about you?
<br>
<br>
Each student goes on their social media accounts like Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube. Scroll through it for a while and note what kind of content is shown to them like dog videos, pranks, makeup tutorials etc.. Afterwards, they share it with another student and talk about what they think the media knows about them. Let them answer the following questions: If you could define yourself by five words from your notes, what would it be? Does that feel like an accurate picture of you? What is missing and why could that be?

    <h2>How is data collected?</h2>
<br>
<em> The following is an assignment to give the student an idea of who is represented in the data. This assignment can be expanded to a bigger project or it can be done just in the classroom, but the goal is to give students practical knowledge about data in a fun way. <br> <br>
</em>
Data is collected about us each time we open our phones and use any service. This knowledge is used in many different ways with AI technologies, but what picture does data create? How can it be helpful? and what is missing?
<br> <br>
Let the students go into smaller groups and create three yes/no questions about each of the subjects: hobbies, health, and friendship. Here is an example:
<br> - Do you like playing video games?
<br> - Do you eat meat?
<br> - Do you have a best friend? <br> <br>
Make a survey using the form below with the three questions either in the classroom or with other students. It can be done with a simple setup like the following.
<br> <br> <img src="./assets/img/datadrawing1.png" alt="" height="150px">

<br> <br> Look at the collected data and see how many people for example said yes to the two first questions and no to the last. What could you conclude from this? For example, a statement could be: people who do not eat meat are more likely to have a best friend.

<br> <br> Talk together about what conclusions you could make from your data. What could you say about youth in general? What was missing in your data set? Who was missing to be represented? If you were a company what could you use this information to?
