    <h2> Who uses AI today? <br> </h2>
Today it is not only youtube using algorithms and data but AI is used in many different settings. As for now it gets incorporated into more and more everyday services and with the following case study, the students get to talk about the pros and cons of using AI in the health system. 
<br> <br> <br>
CASE <br>
There are many advantages to using algorithms in the healthcare systems, for example, doctors have better knowledge on which to base their decisions. There are also some cons, for example, algorithms are made to predict the best treatment, and they are trained to reproduce the decisions contained in the data it is trained on. Therefore if doctors tend to generally underdiagnosed men with depression, while women have not, artificial intelligence will do the same when it diagnoses depression. This means that prejudices and stereotypes that already exist in society will be reflected in the algorithms and they will begin to be used as decision-making tools (Ingemann, Christian, and Holstein, Nana 2023).
<br> <br>
Discuss the case with the students. What are some ethical, social and legal aspects? What do you think about the use of AI, data and algorithms? 
<br>
  </div>
  <div><h2>How does ChatGPT work? <br> </h2>
    <br> <br>
    Explore together with the students <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> by asking them to explore the internet's knowledge about the students' everyday lives.
It could for example be: <br> <br>
- Who is (the student's name)? <br>
- What kind of school is (school name)? <br>
- What are the pros and cons of AI? <br>
- Write me a joke for a kid, grandparent, etc. <br>
- Who created ChatGPT and with what purpose? <br> <br>
Let them come up with more questions around the same themes. <br> <br>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>What are the impacts of AI? <br> </h2>
<br> <br>
Let the students talk two and two facing each other. After each question, ask them to find a new partner to talk to about the next question. Follow up with making a pro and cons about ChatGPT/AI with the students.
<br> <br>
- What does chatGPT know about you and your life? <br>
- Where do you think it has its knowledge from? <br>
- From whom could it be missing knowledge and inputs? Who is not present on the internet? <br>
- What can ChatGPT be used for? <br>
- On a scale from 1-10, how accurate do you think ChatGPT is and why? <br>
- On a scale from 1-10, how useful do you think ChatGPT is and why? <br>
<br> <br>
End talk <br> <br>
End the workshop with a line in the classroom where one end agrees and the other disagrees, and ask the students to move according to the statement: 
<br> - Do you think AI is good for our future? <br>
